# Combo Combat System
A gameplay prototype focused on building a state driven character controller and a responsive combo based combat system with animation support.

The project was designed to explore attack chaining, player feedback, and clean separation of combat states.

## My Focus
- Implemented a state machine driven player controller
- Built a combo attack system
- Integrated sprinting and player feedback systems
- Created target dummy actors to safely test combat interactions

## Tech
- Engine: Unity 6
- Language: C#
- Key systems: State machines, animation-driven combat, input handling, player feedback

## What I Learned / Would Improve
- Gained experience structuring combat logic using clear state separation
- To improve the project I would focus on animation blending.
